class Persona:

    Persona configuration for the scenario.

    Attributes:
        role: The role of the persona, e.g., "human user" or "helpful AI agent".
        name: The name of the persona, e.g. "Bob", "Lisa", "Charlie", etc.
              The name and role will be combined to a sentence like
              "You are a {role} named {name}." in the system prompt.
        background: The background of the persona, e.g.,
            - For user: "You are a student who is studying at the university.
              You like to play basketball in your free time"
            - For agent: "You are a helpful AI agent who can help the user with their questions and tasks."
        personality: Detailed description on the personality of the persona.
            For example:
            - For user:
              - "You are determined and straightforward, but sometime you make mistakes."
              - "You are passive in communication, unclear in needs, repeatedly seeks confirmation,
                and slow in decision-making."
            - For agent:
              - "You have a great sense of humor while being helpful and friendly to the user.
                Your responses are concise and conversational."
              - "You are friendly and helpful to the user. You can guide the user to finish
                their task when they show hesitation."
        language: The language used by the persona, e.g. "English", "Chinese", "Spanish", etc.
            Only used for TTS generation. If provided, the prompt will have additional information
            about the language.
        accent: The accent of the persona if any, e.g. "American", "British", "Australian", etc.
            Only used for TTS generation. If provided, the prompt will have additional information
            about the accent.
        behavior_config: Pipeline-layer persona knobs that the LLM alone cannot realize —
            e.g. interrupt_tendency, enable_interruptions, backchannel_min_threshold,
            use_llm_backchannel. Currently parked: not consumed by ``to_prompt_section`` and
            not wired into the turn-taking pipeline. Future work; preserved here as a
            metric-slicing label and as a forward-compatible carrier for tau2-derived
            persona configs.

            channel/source/speech_effects, telephony_enabled, environment,
            background_noise_file, etc.). Currently parked: not consumed by

            name: The name of the scenario.
            description: The description of the scenario.
            max_duration: The max duration of the scenario in seconds.
            reference_answer: The reference answer for the scenario, must be able to be converted to a json string.

                transcript; aggregate score is ``passed / total``. Default ``None``
                disables NL-assertion scoring.
            env_assertions: Environment-state assertion records evaluated against the
                pulled ``shared_state["user_db"]`` or ``shared_state["db"]`` post-run
                (e.g., tau2-telecom). Each entry has shape

                ``{"env_type": "user"|"assistant", "func_name": str, "arguments": dict}``.
                Default ``None`` skips replay.
